# EDRP Frontend
EDRP Frontend is a project that aims to develop more efficient, better looking & intuitive UI/UX for [HNBGU Online](https://online.hnbgu.ac.in) which is not up to the mark to say the least.
## Why We Need A New UI?
### [HNBGU Online](https://online.hnbgu.ac.in) Lacks Mobile Support
Website currently does not support mobile displays at all. All the webpages are not designed with mobile view in mind. This makes it very difficult to be used on mobile. Given more than 1/3rd of the traffic is mobile, it causes usability problems to a large part of the student population.

### It Has Cluttered UI Leading To Bad UX
There is just too much on the screen at one time. Most of the information is not useful to the particular user, they struggle to find what they are looking for.

### Website Looks Old
This is subjective but the website does look kind of old. very basic styling is done with bare minimum use of javascript. This particularly does not affect any functionality but better color pallates that match the university branding are not used.
## What do we propose?
## Using Newer Avaialable Technologies 
There are a lot of new technologies that will make the website faster and also better looking. It will help in dividing the code better, provide features like state management and make it super easy building it.
## Following Design Systems
By following a design system like material design or carbon by IBM, we reduce the effort to develop a better looking UI. All the magical numbers are already cranked up. We just use & build on top of it.
## Solving UX Problems
We need to solve the UX problems because it is indeed a complex system. There are many user types and their is a limit of how much you can fit into one screen. For example to reduce clutter we can design multiple pages that take care of specific user needs rather than flooding everything on the front page.

# Long Term Objectives Of The Project
* Make checking results, filling forms & other tasks  a hassle free and easy job for students by developing better UI
* Also to make it easier for other users of the website ( teachers, other colleges, admins) to do their online tasks.

# Long Term Goal Of The Project
Long term goal of the project is to migrate the whole UI/UX of this website to give it a fresh look & to continuously provide new updates as per feedback from the users. It is to create a self-sustaining project that takes care of our EDRP's frontend.

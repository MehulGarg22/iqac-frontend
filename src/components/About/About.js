        Internal Quality Assurance Cell develops a quality system for conscious,
        consistent and catalytic action to improve the academic and
        administrative performance of the Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal
        University (HNBGU). This generates a lot of data about the university
        and its academic performance. But the process of collecting this data is
        inefficient. It involves filling tedious word documents, printing these
        documents and manually generating annual reports. But this data is
        unorganised and is stored in word documents and excel files. It is hard
        to extract insights or urgently needed data. It costs more both in terms
        of time and money to the university.<br></br>We propose a solution to
        this as an online portal for the Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC)
        to fulfil its data needs. This system will collect, store and organise
        IQAC’s data. Data collection will be done through its web interface.
        Multiple users like Deans, HOD, Faculties etc can login with their
        credentials and provide the relevant data of their department/school. On
        the other hand, they can also easily access their department/school’s
        data. Other than this, insights can be derived and reports can be
        automatically generated about the performance of the university. This
        can help the university easily generate compliant reports, even multiple
        types of reports with each one having a different focus.<br></br> A
        modern system will help in many ways. It will be able to collect data
        faster and more efficiently, which will allow the university to use the
        data to make more accurate decisions about their students, faculty and
        staff. This will allow them to help students more effectively. This
        system will also help the university in getting a good score in the
        National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC).<br></br> IQAC’s
        data needs are big and they can be better handled with an online system
        with data collection, storage and organisation at its heart. It is
        currently an inefficient way which is time and resource consuming. As we
        know our university has 3 campuses and 100+ colleges are affiliated with
        it, this could cut down on a lot of cost both time and money-wise.
